| **Shanna Daly** | [Fancy4n6](https://linktr.ee/shannadaly) <br> Tiring of being asked what companies I'd recommend for various pieces of cyber security work, Shanna took to Slack to ask around. She'd gone and looked at [AUCyberscape](https://aucyberscape.com/) only to find that the last updates looked to have been in 2020 and the site was no longer maintained. She also found that searching the site for specific products and services was actually quite difficult. So the idea was born to create a directory of Australian owned and run cyber security companies that was easy to search, be able to find the services and products you want easily and these companies be vetted and validated. If you are up on your OSINT, you will see she bought this domain `cyberanode` sometime ago and has finally found it a home. |
| **Josh Williams** | [Barnie995](https://twitter.com/Barnie995) <br> I believe the words that Barnie uttered that landed him involved with this were "If it can be kept up to date and easily (So multiple people assisting you Shanna), sounds like a good idea". |
